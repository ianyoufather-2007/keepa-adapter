# Changelog

## 1.1.1 - 2026-05-08

### Fixed
- **Stable MCPB download link for websites.** `npm run mcpb:pack` now writes both the versioned bundle and `release/keepa-adapter.mcpb`, so GitHub Releases can expose a permanent `/releases/latest/download/keepa-adapter.mcpb` URL that does not break on version bumps.

## 1.1.0 - 2026-05-07

### Fixed
- **Claude Desktop MCPB install now avoids native SQLite failures.** Replaced `better-sqlite3` with `sql.js`, a pure JavaScript/WebAssembly SQLite implementation, and moved the default database to `~/.keepa-adapter/keepa.db` so Claude's `/` working directory does not cause write failures.
- **Buy box data now populated correctly.** Added `buybox=1` parameter to Keepa API calls for `keepa_get_product`, `keepa_get_buy_box`, `keepa_get_seller_stats`, and `keepa_take_snapshot`. Previously these fields (`buy_box_seller_id`, `buy_box_price`, `out_of_stock_percentage`, `buyBoxStats`) were silently returned as null because the buy box module was never requested.

### Added
- **Configurable default marketplace.** Set `KEEPA_DEFAULT_DOMAIN` in your `.env` (e.g. `uk`, `de`, `jp`) so international users don't need to pass `domain` on every tool call. Defaults to `com` if unset.

### Token usage note
- The buy box fix increases token cost slightly for the four affected tools, as Keepa charges extra tokens for the buy box module (~2 additional tokens per ASIN). Normal usage should not be significantly impacted.
